## Technical Implementation

> The following are the example of awesome framework and libraries used in this movie-admin-movies project

- [x] `react-admin` Utilizing material UI, this framework has many useful components and mechanics to create an admin dashboard. It supports responsive design, provides CRUD functionality for the front-end, offers a skeleton for REST data provider to communicate with multiple backends, enable searching and pagination, allows for exporting resource data to the CSV format, to name a few.
- [x] `react-stack-grid` Pinterest like layout to present a list of React components. Implemented to show movie grids
- [x] `react-day-picker` A flexible date picker for React. Used to filter the movies by release date
- [x] `react-d3-speedometer` To present movie profitability in the movie detail's stats tab
- [x] `react-event-timeline` To show the movie reviews from the popup dialog from the movie grid
- [x] `react-vertical-timeline-component` To show the filtered movies in a chronological order
- [x] `react-vis, victory, and dx-chart` for some movie stat visualization
- [x] `recompose` compose the currying functions that returns higher order components(HOCs). VoteSlideFilter component is functional-based using recompose to combine decorators, thus allowing us to add handlers, simple local states, withStyles, etc, in a very readable fashion. For example:

```js

...

const enhance = compose(
  withConnectedRedux,
  withState("voteCount", "setVoteCount", 1000),
  withHandlers({
    onVoteCountChange: onVoteChangeHandler
  }),
  withStyles(styles)
);

export default enhance(VoteFilterSlider);
```
